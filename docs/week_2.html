        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>For the final project my first thought was making a new version of a mobile robot platform
            I designed back in the days when I was still in upper secondary school.
        </p>

        <p>The platform is fairly robust, but the Fusion 360 model is a huge mess,
            and the battery that I designed the robot around the robot is starting to be a thing of the past.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the main motivation behind this revival is that the entire platform is 3D-printable,
            except for the bolts, bearings and electronics, which makes this a fair bit more maker friendly.
            But I guess only a bit.
        </p>

        <h1>Functionality</h1>
        <p>
            This platform is essentially a mobile robot, if it has a way to handle locomotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the final version I wish to include a lidar with simple obstacle avoidance, but I am afraid that
            this will definitely be outside the scope of this course. And for locomotion, I think that using only an
            ESP32 will prove to be too difficult (concidering the vast amount of theorical knowledge needed, and
            that I certainly lack on this area)
            to be able to obtain any awareness of position in room, or trying
            to map a room's structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I want to obtain instead is to have an easily accessible open source platform
            that is capable of holonomic motion.

            The use cases I see for this kind of platform is sensor testing, as well as navigation algorithm testing.
        </p>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>
            For this kind of project, I have to stretch the rules a bit. In theory, this platform should
            fullfill all of the required elements for a Fab Academy courses project.
        </p>
        <p>The core of this platform is a flat plane with a couple of cutouts. This could be done with a laser cutter.
            For the electronics part I could do these things:
            <ul class="listElement">
                <li>Power management circuitry<ul>
                    <li>Current measurement</li>
                    <li>Cell voltage</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Integrated wheel control unit<ul>
                    <li>Absolute encoders with magnets</li>
                    <li>Velocity control</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Environment sensing<ul>
                    <li>Spinning TOF sensor</li>
                    <li>Locomotion based on optical flow estimation</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>And now that the project is in the starting point, I strongly believe that studying power management
            design might prove to be the most useful one.
        </p>
